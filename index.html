				*Disclaimer*<br><br>
        This is an interactive game that discusses the symptoms of depression. Some of the events discussed may be triggering if you currently or have in the past gone through these events. If you are struggling with any of these symptoms, you are not alone in your efforts to fight. Don't be afraid to get help because life is worth living. If you are someone who has never experienced depression, hopefully you will learn how to better interact with someone who is.<br><br>

        I highly recommend you watch this quick video if you don't understand depression:<br><br>
